            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Skin Care through the ages - 40's...</h1><p>FORTIES Deeper lines begin to etch around the mouth and eyes, furrows appear on the forehead and circles under the eyes may grow into pouches.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Skin Care through the ages - 50's...</h1><p>FIFTIES By now, skin starts to acquire true 'character' in the form of fine wrinkles, and the lines you develop in your fifties and sixties may deepen into folds. This is because, post-menopausal, there's much less estrogen being produced and without estrogen, skin becomes thinner and more fragile.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4ce4475b5c200499dfc52b993a263826/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0201%2F6136%2Ffiles%2Fbesthairstylesforwomenover50_41_large.jpg%3F16052303526860689522"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is There A Link Between Diet And Acne?</h1><p>Acne is considered to be the disease of our Western culture. It is virtually non-existent in non-westernized societies where refined carbohydrates and sugar are rarely eaten.
