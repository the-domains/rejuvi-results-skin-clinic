## Keeping Skin Hydrated Matters

Your skin is the foundation of your beauty. If you want to have skin that is amazingly beautiful, you will need to start with ensuring that you skin is hydrated. Consider a plant. When the plant's leaves get dry,they start to crack and they show their age. The good news is that even with plants, as the leaves are fully hydrated and are regularly hydrated, they will start to get a deep green color and look full of life.  
The same is true for your skin. No matter what it looks like today, it can likely have improvement through hydration.

There are many ways to build up this hydrated look. What many people do not realize, though, is that the process starts with drinking enough water. Your body needs a constant supply of quality water to keep each of the cells in your body hydrated properly. Drinking other products, including juices and soda can hurt your skin. While they are fluids, they are not giving your cells enough hydration. You need water.

In addition to this, there are other ways to keep your skin hydrated. For example, during the cold winter months, the cold air can be killer on drying out your skin. Instead of allowing this to happen, apply a good moisturizer to any exposed skin. This can help to lock in the hydration so that you are less likely to be hurt by the intense temperatures.

Next, consider a hydrating mist**.** These can be found at most good beauty salons and skin clinics.You simply need to spray the mist on and you will, without a doubt, have a more hydrated look. Use the other methods first, and then use this hydrating mist as a way to keep your skin looking good.  
Finally, don't layer on the makeup. Your skin does need to breath. Choose make up products that are mineral or at least made up of products that are not harmful to your skin. Some make up products can dry out the skin themselves.

When choosing anything that has to do with your skin, from make up to the sun screen you put on, always keep in mind the actual effect it will have on your skin. You never want a product that will draw out the moisture from your skin but instead, you do want those that lock it in: like AHA based products.
